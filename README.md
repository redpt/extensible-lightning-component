# extensible-lightning-component
This is meant to be a Lightning Component that is extended by other Lightning Components. By definition, it cannot be a stand-alone Lightning Component.

In order to utilize this, after creating the component in your org, your new Lightning Component must utilize in the markup:
    extends = "LightningUtilities"

Additionally, understand that you also need to use the included Apex controller and (TODO) the test class.
